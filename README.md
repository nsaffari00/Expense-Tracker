# Expense Tracker Project

This project is an expense tracking system that helps users add, view, filter, and delete expenses, and calculate the total of all expenses. The system stores expense details in a Python dictionary. 

## Features:
- **Add New Expense**: Allows users to input expense details such as category, amount, and date.
- **View All Expenses**: Displays all recorded expenses.
- **Calculate Total Expenses**: Summarizes the total amount of all expenses.
- **Filter Expenses by Category**: Filters and displays expenses of a specific category.
- **Delete Expense**: Deletes expenses based on category and date.
- **Summarize Expenses by Month**: Groups and sums expenses by month.

## Roles & Tasks:
- **Chris**: Implemented the add_expense() function that allows users to input expense details (category, amount, date).  Worked on the `filter_expenses()` and `delete_expense()` functions, allowing users to filter and delete expenses based on criteria.
- **Nikan**: Developed the calculate_total() function that sums up all the expense amounts.

## Challenges:
- **Input Validation**: Ensuring the user inputs valid amounts and dates was a key challenge. We handled it with error messages and validation checks to prevent crashes.
- **Collaborative Coding**: Merging changes from multiple branches was initially tricky, especially when two members worked on similar code sections. We overcame this by regularly syncing with the main branch and communicating any changes.

## Reflection:
We enjoyed the process of collaborating on this project. While there were a few technical challenges, especially around merging code and coordinating our work on GitHub, it was rewarding to see how each member's contributions came together to form a complete project. We found that splitting tasks based on strengths made the process smoother and more efficient. However, sometimes we ran into merge conflicts, which required extra communication and careful management of branches.

Overall, this was a great learning experience, and we appreciate the opportunity to work together as a team.
