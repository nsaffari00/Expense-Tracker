Expense Tracker Project

This project is an expense tracking system that helps users add, view, filter, and delete expenses, and calculate the total of all expenses. The system stores expense details in a Python dictionary. 

Features:
- Add New Expense: Allows users to input expense details such as category, amount, and date.
- View All Expenses: Displays all recorded expenses.
- Calculate Total Expenses: Summarizes the total amount of all expenses.
- Filter Expenses by Category: Filters and displays expenses of a specific category.
- Delete Expense: Deletes expenses based on category and date.
- Summarize Expenses by Month: Groups and sums expenses by month.

Roles & Tasks:
- Christos: Made the add_expense() function that allows users to input expense details (category, amount, date). Made the view_expenses() fucnction that allows users to see their saved expenses. Worked on delete_expense() function, allowing users to and delete expenses. Worked on the filter_expenses function which allows user to filter espenses based of criteria. 

- Nikan: Made the calculate_total() function that sums up all the expense amounts. Made the summarize_by_month() function that groups up and summarizes expenses by the month. Worked on delete_expense() function, allowing users to and delete expenses. Worked on the filter_expenses function which allows user to filter espenses based of criteria.

Challenges:
- Input Validation: Ensuring the user inputs valid amounts and dates was a key challenge. We handled it with error messages and validation checks to prevent crashes.
- Collaborative Coding: Merging changes from multiple branches was tricky, especially when we both worked on the same sections. We overcame this by regularly syncing with the main branch and communicating with eachother when we made any changes.

Reflection:
We enjoyed the process of collaborating on this project. While there were a few technical challenges, especially around merging code and coordinating our work on GitHub, we found that splitting tasks based on strengths made the process smoother and more efficient. However, sometimes we ran into merge conflicts, which required extra communication.

Overall, this was a great learning experience, and we appreciate the opportunity to work together as a team.
